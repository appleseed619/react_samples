# Make 20 React Apps

![](https://scotch-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1587260533/make-20-react-apps-1200-630_rnrnvg.png)

In this repo, you'll find the starter files and the finished files for the 20 React Apps that we make in the course: [Make 20 React Apps](https://20ReactApps.com)

## To Start

Each application has its own folder. In each app folder is a `finished` and `start` folder. You can see the final app or start working in the start folder with the following steps:

1. `cd` into a folder
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn`
3. Start the React app: `npm start` or `yarn start`

Need some help? I've got a chatbox on my site [courses.chrisoncode.io](https://courses.chrisoncode.io) that you can use to chat with me.

## Pull Requests

If you've found some problems with the files and apps we've built, I'm happy to look at pull requests. I try to keep these files as **close to the videos** as possible so I'm not looking for full rewrites.

Any big errors or clarifications that you see, pull requests are appreciated!
