## To Start

Clone this repo. Or you can fork it so that you can track your progress in your own repo.

1. Clone it: `git clone git@github.com:chris-on-code/20-react-apps.git`

Each application has its own folder. In each app folder is a `finished` and `start` folder. You can see the final app or start working in the start folder with the following steps:

1. `cd` into a folder
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn`
3. Start the React app: `npm start` or `yarn start`

## Pull Requests

If you've found some problems with the files and apps we've built, I'm happy to look at pull requests. I try to keep these files as **close to the videos** as possible so I'm not looking for full rewrites.

Any big errors or clarifications that you see, pull requests are appreciated!
